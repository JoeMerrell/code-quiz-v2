## Description

From the UCLA Coding Bootcamp challenge description: "To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this weekâ€™s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write." My version of this app leads the user through 7 questions (the number can vary depending on how many questions are added to the questions.js file) and, if successfully answered within the given time limit, will present the user with a score. Next steps for the app will involve keeping track of high scores.
